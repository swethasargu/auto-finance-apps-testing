This repository documents my insights gained from my extensive experience in testing Auto Finance Applications. As a Software Test Lead, I played a key role in this project for a period of 2 years.


Project: Loan Origination and Servicing for Auto Finance Company


Description: 
This project aims to test the accuracy and functionality of scanned documents in relation to the database, front-end application, and Captiva application. Auto finance clients scan customer documents, which are then stored in centralized repositories. Internal classification and storage in Documentum follow. As a test engineer, my role is to ensure 99% accurate tagging by the application. Captiva is configured by the development team to process and extract information using OCR, saving it in the Oracle Customer database. The front-end application retrieves data from the database and provides access to scanned documents in Documentum. Testing involves validating data consistency between the front-end UI, the database, and the Documentum repository, focusing on accuracy and tag extraction.

Tools used: Quality Center, SQL Developer, Captiva, Documentum, OBIEE Reports, Siebel CRM, Soap UI, DQRT, Dealertrack, RouteOne, Daybreak, Leasepak.
